We are on the lookout for an ambitious, data-driven, and exceptionally driven Growth Product Manager to join our growing team and spearhead initiatives that accelerate user acquisition, activation, revenue, referral, retention and resurrection metrics.

Growth Product Managers are the CEO of their product's growth, leading cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists, growth hackers, designers (and other roles). They are obsessed with identifying and executing on opportunities across the entire user lifecycle, leveraging data and experimentation to drive significant impact. They are responsible for every aspect of product growth including user research focused on growth levers, UX/UI design for conversion and retention, engineering growth features, quality, deep data analytics to uncover insights, and collaborating on marketing and acquisition strategies.

About Us:

Thirteen-time Webby award-winning Freelancer.com is the world’s largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplace by total number of users and projects posted with more than 80 million users who have posted 25 million jobs. We work with everyone from consumers to NASA in over 3,000 areas as diverse as website development, marketing, copywriting, astrophysics, aerospace engineering and manufacturing.

Freelancer owns Escrow.com, the world’s largest online escrow company with over US$8 billion in transactions secured, powering the sale of jet parts to oil wells. Freelancer also owns Loadshift, a marketplace with more freight on a typical day than the distance from the earth to the moon, with over 650 million kilometres posted since inception.

This won't be your typical cog-in-the-machine type of job. If you're a high achiever with talent, looking for something more than a boring job in corporate, want to work with the best and brightest and don't need to be handheld, this is the job for you.

If you join a mega-cap technology company as the 10,000th hire you might struggle to figure out the impact you are making. If you join a startup, you might get to work on the latest fad, but likely have few mentors to learn from, work on toy problems and never change the world.

At Freelancer you’ll get to work on a highly diverse, global set of internet-scale challenges where you will make a meaningful difference with real responsibility, while rapidly building your skills. We run a meritocracy - we actively promote from within.

You’ll also change lives- our mission is to provide one billion jobs. Not many companies actually make a difference like Freelancer does in providing opportunity and income to people all around the world.
